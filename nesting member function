    //                           --> no methods
    //    classes --> structures + more
    //classes ---> can have methods and properties
    //classes----->can make few members as private and few as public
    //structure are typedef
    //u can declare objects along with d class declaration like these
    // i,e  class emp{
    //class defination
    // }   //harry, rohan, lewish
    //rana.salary-- it makes no sence if salry is private
    //nesting of member function
